```

Where:
- `command` is the name of the program
- `[options]` are flags that modify the command's behavior (optional)
- `[arguments]` are the targets the command operates on (optional)

Options usually come in two forms:
- Short form: Single letter preceded by a dash (e.g., `-a`)
- Long form: Full word preceded by two dashes (e.g., `--all`)
